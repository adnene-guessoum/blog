# Let's build a blog using django

- Django Rest Framework - Postgresql backend
- React frontend
- CI/CD Github actions
- Docker-compose development: persisting volumes, bind mount, Task automation...
- linting, formatting, poetry, etc...

## TODO :

- CD pipeline to AWS
- write tests !!!
- Implement User models: commenting, upvoting, sharing blog posts...
- Improve UX/UI (meaning make it look nice)
- write some stuff I guess

## wana help out ?

Fork, clone, start docker and run

```
task install

task docker-build
```

should work. works on my machine anyway ;)

## also, if any suggestions or critics, do not hesitate.
